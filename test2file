3. Production Deployment Process & Testing Pipeline Integration
	•	The discussion revolves around whether the testing pipeline should be integrated into the deployment pipeline or kept separate.
	•	It was noted that production testing should not block the deployment process, meaning both can function independently.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Document the production deployment process.
	•	List out the exact steps involved (including pre-checks, deployment cadence, and post-deployment validation).
	•	Decide whether the testing pipeline needs a waiting time (e.g., 12 minutes after deployment) before starting execution.
	•	Use ‘Annuity New Business Hub’ as an example to define this cadence properly.
	•	Evaluate if we need to introduce a ‘pause state’ after deployment before testing starts.

⸻

4. Release Calendar for Annuity Area
	•	There’s a need to standardize the release schedule for deployments.
	•	Options discussed:
	•	Fixed deployment windows (e.g., 2nd & 4th Friday of every month).
	•	A more staggered approach to prevent bottlenecks if multiple applications are scheduled at the same time.
	•	Challenges Identified:
	•	If too many applications are scheduled for deployment on the same day, it could create resource constraints.
	•	The effort required per deployment varies, so we need real-time insights to decide on frequency.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Monitor upcoming deployments to see how much effort is needed per application.
	•	Decide on a flexible but structured release plan based on actual needs rather than arbitrary scheduling.
	•	Ensure DevOps and Release teams have clear expectations for each deployment cycle.

To create a structured plan for Production Deployment Process & Testing Pipeline Integration and Release Calendar for Annuity Area, let’s break them down further.

⸻

3. Production Deployment Process & Testing Pipeline Integration

Key Considerations:
	•	Should testing be integrated with the deployment pipeline?
	•	Some teams prefer separating them to prevent testing failures from blocking production releases.
	•	Others integrate them to ensure that deployments are validated in real-time.
	•	How long should we wait before starting automated testing after deployment?
	•	Example: If an application takes time to stabilize after deployment, should we introduce a wait time (e.g., 12 minutes) before testing starts?
	•	How does Annuity New Business Hub handle deployments today?
	•	If it already has a structured deployment process, we should align other applications similarly.

Action Plan:

✅ Step 1: Document the Production Deployment Process
	•	List out the exact steps followed during deployment.
	•	Include pre-deployment checks, execution steps, and post-deployment validations.
	•	Identify dependencies on external services, database updates, or API integrations.

✅ Step 2: Define Testing Integration Strategy
	•	Identify which tests should run post-deployment (e.g., smoke tests, regression tests, API checks).
	•	Determine if testing should happen immediately after deployment or with a delay.
	•	Specify how test results should be handled (e.g., should failures trigger rollback?).

✅ Step 3: Evaluate the Impact on the Overall Deployment Pipeline
	•	Assess whether integrating testing with deployment slows down releases.
	•	Check if testing infrastructure can handle parallel test executions for multiple services.

✅ Step 4: Align with Annuity New Business Hub’s Deployment Model
	•	Use the existing process in Annuity New Business Hub as a reference.
	•	If a deployment cadence is already working well there, adapt it for other applications.

✅ Step 5: Create a Testing & Deployment Workflow
	•	Establish a flowchart showing when deployment happens and when testing kicks in.
	•	Define alert mechanisms if issues are found post-deployment.

⸻

4. Release Calendar for Annuity Area

Key Considerations:
	•	How frequently should deployments happen?
	•	Fixed schedules (e.g., 2nd & 4th Friday of each month) ensure predictability.
	•	A flexible approach allows releases based on demand but may create bottlenecks.
	•	Are there resource constraints?
	•	If multiple applications release on the same day, DevOps and testing teams may get overloaded.
	•	What are the current pain points?
	•	Are teams struggling with last-minute deployments?
	•	Are there issues with coordination between development, DevOps, and testing teams?

Action Plan:

✅ Step 1: Identify the Current Deployment Patterns
	•	Gather data on past releases (frequency, effort, and issues encountered).
	•	Identify if teams prefer fixed or flexible release schedules.

✅ Step 2: Create a Deployment Calendar Proposal
	•	Decide whether to adopt a bi-weekly release model (e.g., 2nd & 4th Fridays).
	•	Alternatively, define a staggered release system where different apps deploy on different days.

✅ Step 3: Monitor Upcoming Deployments & Adjust Plan
	•	Track the number of applications scheduled for release in a given window.
	•	Ensure DevOps and testing teams have sufficient bandwidth to handle multiple releases.

✅ Step 4: Communicate the Deployment Plan
	•	Share the finalized calendar with all stakeholders.
	•	Ensure all teams understand the schedule and escalation process for urgent releases.

✅ Step 5: Implement a Trial Phase
	•	Run a pilot for 1-2 months and refine the process based on real-world feedback.

Planning a deployment cadence for 21 modules on a 6-week cycle needs a balanced, efficient schedule that avoids team burnout, ensures testing coverage, and gives room for hotfixes or urgent changes.

Here’s a step-by-step strategy to help you implement it effectively:

⸻

1. Objectives of the Deployment Cadence
	•	Ensure predictable, repeatable releases every 6 weeks.
	•	Avoid resource overload (DevOps, QA, support).
	•	Allow time for code freeze, regression, UAT, and rollback buffer.
	•	Align with business priorities and risk tolerance.

⸻

2. Assumptions
	•	Each module is deployed independently.
	•	The modules may have dependencies but can be managed.
	•	You want to avoid deploying all 21 at once to reduce risk.

⸻

3. Cadence Options

Option A: Staggered Weekly Deployments
	•	Deploy 3–4 modules per week for 6 weeks.
	•	Example pattern:

	•	Pros:
	•	Continuous momentum.
	•	Lower load each week for DevOps and QA.
	•	Cons:
	•	Every week needs to be “release-ready”.
	•	Complicated coordination for dependent modules.

⸻

Option B: Batch-Based Every 2 Weeks
	•	Split 21 modules into 3 batches of 7 modules.
	•	Deploy every 2nd and 4th Friday in the 6-week window.
	•	Week 2: Batch 1 (Modules 1–7)
	•	Week 4: Batch 2 (Modules 8–14)
	•	Week 6: Batch 3 (Modules 15–21)
	•	Pros:
	•	Enough buffer between deployments.
	•	Easier regression and stability monitoring.
	•	Cons:
	•	Higher risk on each batch since it has 7 modules.

⸻

Option C: Priority + Dependency Driven
	•	Group modules based on:
	•	Business criticality
	•	Inter-dependencies
	•	Release readiness
	•	Deploy dependent modules together, and others as standalones.

Example:
	•	Week 1: High-risk or foundational modules (e.g., Auth, APIs).
	•	Week 3: Dependent business modules (e.g., Quoting, Enrollment).
	•	Week 5: Standalone low-risk modules.

⸻

4. Include a Code Freeze & Testing Buffer
	•	Week -1 (Pre-release week):
	•	Freeze all modules going into Week 1 deployment.
	•	Run full regression and integration tests.
	•	Include UAT or smoke testing during early part of each release week.
	•	Allocate 1–2 days after deployment for post-deployment validation.

⸻

5. Tools & Automation to Help
	•	JIRA/ServiceNow Calendar: Visualize deployments.
	•	CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions): Automate builds and deployments.
	•	Feature Flags: Enable safe deployments without exposing unfinished features.
	•	Dashboards: Show deployment readiness, test coverage, rollback success.

⸻

6. Monitoring and Feedback Loop
	•	Conduct retrospectives every 6 weeks.
	•	Track:
	•	Deployment success rate
	•	Rollback frequency
	•	QA/DevOps bandwidth issues
	•	Adjust cadence if needed (e.g., shift from 6 weeks to 8 weeks if overloaded).

9. Risks & Mitigations

Here’s how you can expand your Production Deployment Cadence Document by including different cadence options and their benefits/challenges—this helps teams understand why the chosen cadence fits best, and what trade-offs are involved.

⸻

11. Deployment Cadence Options & 	•	Reduced risk
	•	Easy rollback
	•	Time for testing & validation | - Slightly longer release time for some modules
	•	Requires tight calendar coordination |
| Option 2: Monthly Deployment – Fixed Dates | Deploy all planned modules on a fixed Friday every month (e.g., 2nd Friday) | - Simplicity
	•	Easier calendar planning | - High load on single day
	•	Increased risk of conflicts
	•	Stress on Ops/support teams |
| Option 3: Bi-weekly Continuous Deployment | Deploy every 2 weeks in small batches | - Fast delivery
	•	Shorter cycle time
	•	Good for agile teams | - Requires high automation
	•	Constant monitoring
	•	Not suitable for all teams |
| Option 4: Quarterly Release (All Modules Together) | Deploy all modules once every quarter | - Low coordination effort
	•	Easy planning for business | - Long wait for fixes/features
	•	High-risk, high-impact deployments |
| Option 5: On-demand (Ad hoc) | Deploy anytime a module is ready | - Max flexibility
	•	Immediate release | - Chaos in scheduling
	•	Requires mature CI/CD and testing automation
	•	No cadence predictability |

⸻

12. Why 6-Week Cadence Was Chosen
	•	Provides balance between speed and stability
	•	Matches internal QA timelines and business readiness
	•	Reduces risk compared to big-bang monthly/quarterly releases
	•	Allows time to validate, fix, and repeat if needed
	•	Enables parallel planning of production support and new features

⸻

13. Scenarios When Cadence Can Be Adjusted
	•	Critical Hotfix: Bypass cycle through exception approval
	•	Low Traffic Windows: May shift deployments to coincide
	•	Major Program Changes: e.g., Year-end blackout, product launch

⸻

14. Future Consideration: Evolving to Agile/DevOps

As teams mature, you can evaluate a shift towards:
	•	Feature-driven deployments
	•	Blue-green or canary releases
	•	Full test automation with CI/CD pipelines
